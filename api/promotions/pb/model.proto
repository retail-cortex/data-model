message CustomerRebateClaim {}

/*
 * A type of CustomerRewardLineItem used to record the earning, redemption and
 * adjustment of REBATES. CUSTOMER REBATES are rewards that a customer earns and
 * may claim after a purchase is completed. Customer rebates may be INSTANT
 * REBATES or DEFERRABLE REBATES.
 *
 * Instant rebates are earned and redeemed within the same transaction.
 * The earning part of an instant rebate is represented by an earn activity code
 * in the parent CustomerRewardLineItem. Instant rebates are subtracted from a
 * purchase price after it is recorded. The rebate value is represented by a
 * redemption/settlement CustomerRewardLineItem.
 *
 * An INSTANT REBATE always has two CustomerRewardLineItem and
 * CustomerRewardRebateLineItem instances for any rebate captured as part of a
 * retail transaction.  The first covers the earning of the rebate (which is a
 * rebate claim).  The second is a rebate redemption/settlement which is the
 * payment of the rebate value to the customer.  To the customer instant rebates
 * are nearly indistinguishable from a discount.  Within the ARTS ODM instant
 * rebates and discounts are very different concepts (see the ODM Narrative
 * Section: Understanding Rebates for a detailed explanation).
 *
 * Customer Rebates may be DEFERRABLE rewards.  This means that a rebate is
 * earned in a transaction, added to a rebate payable balance and paid to the
 * customer at a future time through a separate transaction.
 *
 * Deferrable rebates will be recorded as two CustomerRewardLineItem -
 * CustomerRewardRebateLineItem entity type instances.  The first captures the
 * earning of a rebate.  The second captures the posting of the liability
 * established for the future return of the rebate value to the customer.
